                <p class="about-text-sections">

                    I am a developer of websites, VR, and games. I mostly use C# and Unity,
                    and created a selection of educational VR games and experiences as an
                    apprentice at Sophia Technologies Ltd. I also enjoy making games and 
                    VR software in my spare time, and I am currently working on bolstering my 
                    knowledge of web development. </br>
                    I am set to begin a Degree Apprenticeship in Digital and Technology Solutions
                    (Software Development) with GSK and the University of Hertfordshire
                    this September, and in the meantime I am working as a Front of House Staff member at The Bulls Head in Turnford.

                <p class="about-text-sections">

                    I want to pursue a career in Software Development because I feel
                    that software is a crucial backbone of our lives and our businesses; 
                    They embody human thoughts and ideas in a visual and permanent way.
                    Software is one of the most accessible and far-reaching mediums in the world, 
                    and every company would benefit from utlising applications in their operations. <br>
                    I love problem solving through writing code and seeing the effects
                    of my work visually and instantly, so I can continually tweak and improve
                    my work to make it the best possible version it can be.

                    Studying a Degree Apprenticeship allows me to gain first-hand practical experience
                    as a software developer, working on real-world projects and using cutting-edge technologies
                    as part of a team, while also working towards a degree to underpin the practical skills I 
                    develop with a theoretical understanding of the technologies I will be involved in. <br>
                    Upon completing the course, I will be a software engineer with multiple years of work experience at 
                    a large reputable coporation as well as holding a Bachelor's Degree in the field, which will solidify my career as a developer.
